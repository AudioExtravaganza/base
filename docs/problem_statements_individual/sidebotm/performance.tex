\section{Performance Metrics}
The main goal of this project is to help bring tools like modular synthesizers into live performances; therefore, our performance metrics will revolve around the impact it has on musicians.
Currently, these are the criteria that are the most important:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost:}
        The device must cost at most 200 USD to create. If the price exceeds this limit, the device would no longer be viable as a cheaper alternative.
        
    \item \textbf{Performance:}
        The device must be able to run a large amount of modules without slowing down; otherwise, the timing of a musicians piece would be compromised.
        
    \item \textbf{Usability:}
        The device must be user friendly to the point that an inexperienced user is able to successfully create interesting sounds. It must also provide more experienced users with enough functionality to keep them engaged.
\end{itemize}
